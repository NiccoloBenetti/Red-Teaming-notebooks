    "\n",
    "This cell runs an automated red teaming attack against the **Gandalf system** (developed by **Lakera**) using **PyRIT**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gandalf** is an interactive AI-powered game designed to challenge users in bypassing prompt defenses across multiple levels. In each level, Gandalf (a character inspired by the wizard from *The Lord of the Rings*) protects a secret password using progressively more advanced defense mechanisms. Your goal is to trick Gandalf into revealing that password.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: To better understand the upcoming attack logic and scoring, it's highly recommended to play Gandalf manually at [https://gandalf.lakera.ai](https://gandalf.lakera.ai) before running automated attacks.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook cell, you can select which Gandalf level to attack via the `gandalf_level` variable. An LLM agent (powered by Azure OpenAI) will attempt to extract the secret password by crafting clever and indirect prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow involves:\n",
    "- A **target system** (`GandalfTarget`) representing the Gandalf level being tested.\n",
    "- An **adversarial agent** (`OpenAIChatTarget`) responsible for generating the attack prompts.\n",
    "- A **scorer** (`GandalfScorer`) that automatically detects whether Gandalf revealed the password.\n",
    "- A **red teaming orchestrator** (`RedTeamingOrchestrator`) that manages the multi-turn attack interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attack strategy (`attack_strategy`) instructs the LLM to avoid obvious password requests and instead use trickery, Lord of the Rings references, or obfuscated instructions to get the password.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the execution, the full conversation between the attacker and Gandalf is printed, along with whether the attack succeeded."
